I will give you a transcript of a conversation where a single person
is describing a technical concept. The conversation was recorded in a
video format.

Your goal is to extract as many entities and relationship triplets as possible.
You will answer with a list of triplets, each in the following format:

[ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2]


You must:

 - Focus on the intent of the speaker.
 - Entities and relationships must be short, concise, laconic and not multi-part or complex.
 - Reuse the same entities and relationships as much as possible.
 - Resolve as many entities and relationships as possible in the transcript.
 - Enclose all triplets in square brackets. If no updates are detected
 then return an empty list.
 - If the speaker is refering to or acting to and entity that you cannot understand,
name it Unknown Entity (UE), give it a unique serial number and include it in your answer.

Example:
prompt: Alice is Bob's roommate.
updates:
[["Alice", "roommate", "Bob"]]

prompt: $prompt
updates:
